# CDS_Mapper
CDS Mapper is a tool to map specific positions, such as methylation sites or motif positions, on bacterial genomes to genes described in their corresponding GenBank files. CDS mapper can also map the query positions to specific length upstream and downstream of the genes annotated in the GenBank file.
